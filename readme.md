## Description
**Dictionary Display Lite** is your personal speech declutterer for NVDA’s dictionary dialogs. You know that long-winded announcement every time you arrow through a list of dictionary entries?

`Pattern: OBS; Replacement: O B S; case: off; Type: Regular expression`

With **Dictionary Display Lite**, you’ll hear only the essentials – instantly:

`OBS O B S off Regular expression`

No more “Pattern:”, “Replacement:”, “case:”, or “Type:” – just the values, spoken smoothly in one breath. It works silently in the background, making your dictionary browsing faster and far more pleasant.

> **Zero setup required:** Install the add-on, open any dictionary dialog (Default, Voice, or Temporary), and focus a list item. NVDA will automatically speak the condensed version. That’s it!

## Why You’ll Love It
If you manage many dictionary entries – for homophones, acronyms, or specialised terminology – you know how repetitive the full announcements can be. Your ears get tired, and your brain works overtime to filter out the noise. **Dictionary Display Lite** handles the filtering for you. It leaves only the information you actually need: the pattern, its replacement, the case sensitivity setting, and the rule type.

It’s like having a personal assistant who knows exactly what to say and what to skip. Whether you’re reviewing, editing, or just exploring your dictionary, every announcement is crisp and to the point.

## What It Removes
* **“Pattern:”** – you already know it’s a pattern.
* **“Replacement:”** – obviously the second part is the replacement.
* **“case:”** – you’ll hear “on” or “off” right after the replacement.
* **“Type:”** – the final word tells you the rule type (Regular expression, Wildcard, etc.).
* All semicolons and extra spaces – for a smooth, continuous flow.

## Still Have Full Control
Don’t worry – the original, detailed text isn’t lost. It’s only hidden from speech. If you ever need to hear every label again (for example, to double-check a field), you can:
* Press **NVDA+Tab** to read the current object with all details, or
* Use the object review commands (**NVDA+numpad**) to explore the raw text.

Dictionary Display Lite never alters your actual dictionary data – it just makes listening a whole lot easier.
